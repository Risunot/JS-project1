1. Create a new array of four items(your favorite games) into the bestGames variable.

2. Write to the console the array and the first item from the array separately.

3. Modify the first item, to some other favorite game by assigning via bracket notation []

4. Add new item of the favorite game to the array by using via bracket notation

5. Add new item of the favorite game to the array by another approach.
 Use one of the javascript native method(function).

6. Try to remove the first item from thebestGames array.

7. The next task is quite tricky, but it can come in handy. Do the same as in the previous task, 
except that you store the deleted value in a variable so that you can use it later.

8. Now, return this removed item back to the bestGames array

9. Imagine a situation where you need to find out how many items are in an array, but 
someone can always change that number of items in the array. It would be good to always 
find the right number.

10. Modify index 0 of the bestGames array. But not just simply rewriting actual value. Modify
 it by replacing with array of values  Last of us 1 and Last of us 2.
 
11. Add new item to the new created nested (multidimensional) array and print it output to the
 console.log() method. You can use whatever approach you want.
